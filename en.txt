directive 2005/36/ec of the european parliament and of the council

of 7 september 2005

on the recognition of professional qualifications

(text with eea relevance)

the european parliament and the council of the european union,

having regard to the treaty establishing the european community, and in particular article 40, article 47(1), the first and third sentences of article 47(2), and article 55 thereof,

having regard to the proposal from the commission [1],

having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee [2],

acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 251 of the treaty [3],

whereas:

(1) pursuant to article 3(1)(c) of the treaty, the abolition, as between member states, of obstacles to the free movement of persons and services is one of the objectives of the community. for nationals of the member states, this includes, in particular, the right to pursue a profession, in a self-employed or employed capacity, in a member state other than the one in which they have obtained their professional qualifications. in addition, article 47(1) of the treaty lays down that directives shall be issued for the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications.

(2) following the european council of lisbon on 23 and 24 march 2000, the commission adopted a communication on "an internal market strategy for services", aimed in particular at making the free provision of services within the community as simple as within an individual member state. further to the communication from the commission entitled "new european labour markets, open to all, with access to all", the european council of stockholm on 23 and 24 march 2001 entrusted the commission with presenting for the 2002 spring european council specific proposals for a more uniform, transparent and flexible regime of recognition of qualifications.

(3) the guarantee conferred by this directive on persons having acquired their professional qualifications in a member state to have access to the same profession and pursue it in another member state with the same rights as nationals is without prejudice to compliance by the migrant professional with any non-discriminatory conditions of pursuit which might be laid down by the latter member state, provided that these are objectively justified and proportionate.

(4) in order to facilitate the free provision of services, there should be specific rules aimed at extending the possibility of pursuing professional activities under the original professional title. in the case of information society services provided at a distance, the provisions of directive 2000/31/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 8 june 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in particular electronic commerce, in the internal market [4], should also apply.

(5) in view of the different systems established for the cross-border provision of services on a temporary and occasional basis on the one hand, and for establishment on the other, the criteria for distinguishing between these two concepts in the event of the movement of the service provider to the territory of the host member state should be clarified.

(6) the facilitation of service provision has to be ensured in the context of strict respect for public health and safety and consumer protection. therefore, specific provisions should be envisaged for regulated professions having public health or safety implications, which provide cross-frontier services on a temporary or occasional basis.

(7) host member states may, where necessary and in accordance with community law, provide for declaration requirements. these requirements should not lead to a disproportionate burden on service providers nor hinder or render less attractive the exercise of the freedom to provide services. the need for such requirements should be reviewed periodically in the light of the progress made in establishing a community framework for administrative cooperation between member states.

(8) the service provider should be subject to the application of disciplinary rules of the host member state having a direct and specific link with the professional qualifications, such as the definition of the profession, the scope of activities covered by a profession or reserved to it, the use of titles and serious professional malpractice which is directly and specifically linked to consumer protection and safety.

(9) while maintaining, for the freedom of establishment, the principles and safeguards underlying the different systems for recognition in force, the rules of such systems should be improved in the light of experience. moreover, the relevant directives have been amended on several occasions, and their provisions should be reorganised and rationalised by standardising the principles applicable. it is therefore necessary to replace council directives 89/48/eec [5] and 92/51/eec [6], as well as directive 1999/42/ec of the european parliament and of the council [7] on the general system for the recognition of professional qualifications, and council directives 77/452/eec [8], 77/453/eec [9], 78/686/eec [10], 78/687/eec [11], 78/1026/eec [12], 78/1027/eec [13], 80/154/eec [14], 80/155/eec [15], 85/384/eec [16], 85/432/eec [17], 85/433/eec [18] and 93/16/eec [19] concerning the professions of nurse responsible for general care, dental practitioner, veterinary surgeon, midwife, architect, pharmacist and doctor, by combining them in a single text.

(10) this directive does not create an obstacle to the possibility of member states recognising, in accordance with their rules, the professional qualifications acquired outside the territory of the european union by third country nationals. all recognition should respect in any case minimum training conditions for certain professions.

(11) in the case of the professions covered by the general system for the recognition of qualifications, hereinafter referred to as "the general system", member states should retain the right to lay down the minimum level of qualification required to ensure the quality of the services provided on their territory. however, pursuant to articles 10, 39 and 43 of the treaty, they should not require a national of a member state to obtain qualifications, which they generally lay down only in terms of the diplomas awarded under their national educational system, where the person concerned has already obtained all or part of those qualifications in another member state. as a result, it should be laid down that any host member state in which a profession is regulated must take account of the qualifications obtained in another member state and assess whether they correspond to those which it requires. the general system for recognition, however, does not prevent a member state from making any person pursuing a profession on its territory subject to specific requirements due to the application of professional rules justified by the general public interest. rules of this kind relate, for example, to organisation of the profession, professional standards, including those concerning ethics, and supervision and liability. lastly, this directive is not intended to interfere with member states' legitimate interest in preventing any of their citizens from evading enforcement of the national law relating to professions.

(12) this directive concerns the recognition by member states of professional qualifications acquired in other member states. it does not, however, concern the recognition by member states of recognition decisions adopted by other member states pursuant to this directive. consequently, individuals holding professional qualifications which have been recognised pursuant to this directive may not use such recognition to obtain in their member state of origin rights different from those conferred by the professional qualification obtained in that member state, unless they provide evidence that they have obtained additional professional qualifications in the host member state.

(13) in order to define the mechanism of recognition under the general system, it is necessary to group the various national education and training schemes into different levels. these levels, which are established only for the purpose of the operation of the general system, have no effect upon the national education and training structures nor upon the competence of member states in this field.

(14) the mechanism of recognition established by directives 89/48/eec and 92/51/eec remains unchanged. as a consequence, the holder of a diploma certifying successful completion of training at post-secondary level of a duration of at least one year should be permitted access to a regulated profession in a member state where access is contingent upon possession of a diploma certifying successful completion of higher or university education of four years' duration, regardless of the level to which the diploma required in the host member state belongs. conversely, where access to a regulated profession is contingent upon successful completion of higher or university education of more than four years, such access should be permitted only to holders of a diploma certifying successful completion of higher or university education of at least three years' duration.

(15) in the absence of harmonisation of the minimum training conditions for access to the professions governed by the general system, it should be possible for the host member state to impose a compensation measure. this measure should be proportionate and, in particular, take account of the applicant's professional experience. experience shows that requiring the migrant to choose between an aptitude test or an adaptation period offers adequate safeguards as regards the latter's level of qualification, so that any derogation from that choice should in each case be justified by an imperative requirement in the general interest.

(16) in order to promote the free movement of professionals, while ensuring an adequate level of qualification, various professional associations and organisations or member states should be able to propose common platforms at european level. this directive should take account, under certain conditions, in compliance with the competence of member states to decide the qualifications required for the pursuit of professions in their territory as well as the contents and the organisation of their systems of education and professional training and in compliance with community law, and in particular community law on competition, of those initiatives, while promoting, in this context, a more automatic character of recognition under the general system. professional associations which are in a position to submit common platforms should be representative at national and european level. a common platform is a set of criteria which make it possible to compensate for the widest range of substantial differences which have been identified between the training requirements in at least two thirds of the member states including all the member states which regulate that profession. these criteria could, for example, include requirements such as additional training, an adaptation period under supervised practice, an aptitude test, or a prescribed minimum level of professional practice, or combinations thereof.

(17) in order to take into account all situations for which there is still no provision relating to the recognition of professional qualifications, the general system should be extended to those cases which are not covered by a specific system, either where the profession is not covered by one of those systems or where, although the profession is covered by such a specific system, the applicant does not for some particular and exceptional reason meet the conditions to benefit from it.

(18) there is a need to simplify the rules allowing access to a number of industrial, commercial and craft activities, in member states where those professions are regulated, in so far as those activities have been pursued for a reasonable and sufficiently recent period of time in another member state, while maintaining for those activities a system of automatic recognition based on professional experience.

(19) freedom of movement and the mutual recognition of the evidence of formal qualifications of doctors, nurses responsible for general care, dental practitioners, veterinary surgeons, midwives, pharmacists and architects should be based on the fundamental principle of automatic recognition of the evidence of formal qualifications on the basis of coordinated minimum conditions for training. in addition, access in the member states to the professions of doctor, nurse responsible for general care, dental practitioner, veterinary surgeon, midwife and pharmacist should be made conditional upon the possession of a given qualification ensuring that the person concerned has undergone training which meets the minimum conditions laid down. this system should be supplemented by a number of acquired rights from which qualified professionals benefit under certain conditions.

(20) to allow for the characteristics of the qualification system for doctors and dentists and the related acquis communautaire in the area of mutual recognition, the principle of automatic recognition of medical and dental specialities common to at least two member states should continue to apply to all specialities recognised on the date of adoption of this directive. to simplify the system, however, automatic recognition should apply after the date of entry into force of this directive only to those new medical specialities common to at least two fifths of member states. moreover, this directive does not prevent member states from agreeing amongst themselves on automatic recognition for certain medical and dental specialities common to them but not automatically recognised within the meaning of this directive, according to their own rules.

(21) automatic recognition of formal qualifications of doctor with basic training should be without prejudice to the competence of member states to associate this qualification with professional activities or not.

(22) all member states should recognise the profession of dental practitioner as a specific profession distinct from that of medical practitioner, whether or not specialised in odontostomatology. member states should ensure that the training given to dental practitioners equips them with the skills needed for prevention, diagnosis and treatment relating to anomalies and illnesses of the teeth, mouth, jaws and associated tissues. the professional activity of the dental practitioner should be carried out by holders of a qualification as dental practitioner set out in this directive.

(23) it did not appear desirable to lay down standardised training for midwives for all the member states. rather, the latter should have the greatest possible freedom to organise their training.

(24) with a view to simplifying this directive, reference should be made to the concept of "pharmacist" in order to delimit the scope of the provisions relating to the automatic recognition of the qualifications, without prejudice to the special features of the national regulations governing those activities.

(25) holders of qualifications as a pharmacist are specialists in the field of medicines and should, in principle, have access in all member states to a minimum range of activities in this field. in defining this minimum range, this directive should neither have the effect of limiting the activities accessible to pharmacists in the member states, in particular as regards medical biology analyses, nor create a monopoly for those professionals, as this remains a matter solely for the member states. the provisions of this directive are without prejudice to the possibility for the member states to impose supplementary training conditions for access to activities not included in the coordinated minimum range of activities. this means that the host member state should be able to impose these conditions on the nationals who hold qualifications which are covered by automatic recognition within the meaning of this directive.

(26) this directive does not coordinate all the conditions for access to activities in the field of pharmacy and the pursuit of these activities. in particular, the geographical distribution of pharmacies and the monopoly for dispensing medicines should remain a matter for the member states. this directive leaves unchanged the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions of the member states forbidding companies from pursuing certain pharmacists' activities or subjecting the pursuit of such activities to certain conditions.

(27) architectural design, the quality of buildings, their harmonious incorporation into their surroundings, respect for natural and urban landscapes and for the public and private heritage are a matter of public interest. mutual recognition of qualifications should therefore be based on qualitative and quantitative criteria which ensure that the holders of recognised qualifications are in a position to understand and translate the needs of individuals, social groups and authorities as regards spatial planning, the design, organisation and realisation of structures, conservation and the exploitation of the architectural heritage, and protection of natural balances.

(28) national regulations in the field of architecture and on access to and the pursuit of the professional activities of an architect vary widely in scope. in most member states, activities in the field of architecture are pursued, de jure or de facto, by persons bearing the title of architect alone or accompanied by another title, without those persons having a monopoly on the pursuit of such activities, unless there are legislative provisions to the contrary. these activities, or some of them, may also be pursued by other professionals, in particular by engineers who have undergone special training in the field of construction or the art of building. with a view to simplifying this directive, reference should be made to the concept of "architect" in order to delimit the scope of the provisions relating to the automatic recognition of the qualifications in the field of architecture, without prejudice to the special features of the national regulations governing those activities.

(29) where a national and european-level professional organisation or association for a regulated profession makes a reasoned request for specific provisions for the recognition of qualifications on the basis of coordination of minimum training conditions, the commission shall assess the appropriateness of adopting a proposal for the amendment of this directive.

(30) in order to ensure the effectiveness of the system for the recognition of professional qualifications, uniform formalities and rules of procedure should be defined for its implementation, as well as certain details of the pursuit of the profession.

(31) since collaboration among the member states and between them and the commission is likely to facilitate the implementation of this directive and compliance with the obligations deriving from it, the means of collaboration should be organised.

(32) the introduction, at european level, of professional cards by professional associations or organisations could facilitate the mobility of professionals, in particular by speeding up the exchange of information between the host member state and the member state of origin. this professional card should make it possible to monitor the career of professionals who establish themselves in various member states. such cards could contain information, in full respect of data protection provisions, on the professional's professional qualifications (university or institution attended, qualifications obtained, professional experience), his legal establishment, penalties received relating to his profession and the details of the relevant competent authority.

(33) the establishment of a network of contact points with the task of providing the citizens of the member states with information and assistance will make it possible to ensure that the system of recognition is transparent. these contact points will provide any citizen who so requests and the commission with all the information and addresses relevant to the recognition procedure. the designation of a single contact point by each member state within this network does not affect the organisation of competencies at national level. in particular, it does not prevent the designation at national level of several offices, the contact point designated within the aforementioned network being in charge of coordinating with the other offices and informing the citizen, where necessary, of the details of the relevant competent office.

(34) administering the various systems of recognition set up by the sectoral directives and the general system has proved cumbersome and complex. there is therefore a need to simplify the administration and updating of this directive to take account of scientific and technical progress, in particular where the minimum conditions of training are coordinated with a view to automatic recognition of qualifications. a single committee for the recognition of professional qualifications should be set up for this purpose, and suitable involvement of representatives of the professional organisations, also at european level, should be ensured.

(35) the measures necessary for the implementation of this directive should be adopted in accordance with council decision 1999/468/ec of 28 june 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the commission [20].

(36) the preparation by the member states of a periodic report on the implementation of this directive, containing statistical data, will make it possible to determine the impact of the system for the recognition of professional qualifications.

(37) there should be a suitable procedure for adopting temporary measures if the application of any provision of this directive were to encounter major difficulties in a member state.

(38) the provisions of this directive do not affect the powers of the member states as regards the organisation of their national social security system and determining the activities which must be pursued under that system.

(39) in view of the speed of technological change and scientific progress, life-long learning is of particular importance for a large number of professions. in this context, it is for the member states to adopt the detailed arrangements under which, through suitable ongoing training, professionals will keep abreast of technical and scientific progress.

(40) since the objectives of this directive, namely the rationalisation, simplification and improvement of the rules for the recognition of professional qualifications, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore be better achieved at community level, the community may adopt measures, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article 5 of the treaty. in accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that article, this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives.

(41) this directive is without prejudice to the application of articles 39(4) and 45 of the treaty concerning notably notaries.

(42) this directive applies, concerning the right of establishment and the provision of services, without prejudice to other specific legal provisions regarding the recognition of professional qualifications, such as those existing in the field of transport, insurance intermediaries and statutory auditors. this directive does not affect the operation of council directive 77/249/eec of 22 march 1977 to facilitate the effective exercise by lawyers of freedom to provide services [21], or of directive 98/5/ec of the european parliament and of the council of 16 february 1998 to facilitate practice of the profession of lawyer on a permanent basis in a member state other than that in which the qualification was obtained [22]. the recognition of professional qualifications for lawyers for the purpose of immediate establishment under the professional title of the host member state should be covered by this directive.

(43) to the extent that they are regulated, this directive includes also liberal professions, which are, according to this directive, those practised on the basis of relevant professional qualifications in a personal, responsible and professionally independent capacity by those providing intellectual and conceptual services in the interest of the client and the public. the exercise of the profession might be subject in the member states, in conformity with the treaty, to specific legal constraints based on national legislation and on the statutory provisions laid down autonomously, within that framework, by the respective professional representative bodies, safeguarding and developing their professionalism and quality of service and the confidentiality of relations with the client.

(44) this directive is without prejudice to measures necessary to ensure a high level of health and consumer protection,

have adopted this directive:

title i

general provisions

article 1

purpose

this directive establishes rules according to which a member state which makes access to or pursuit of a regulated profession in its territory contingent upon possession of specific professional qualifications (referred to hereinafter as the host member state) shall recognise professional qualifications obtained in one or more other member states (referred to hereinafter as the home member state) and which allow the holder of the said qualifications to pursue the same profession there, for access to and pursuit of that profession.

article 2

scope

1. this directive shall apply to all nationals of a member state wishing to pursue a regulated profession in a member state, including those belonging to the liberal professions, other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications, on either a self-employed or employed basis.

2. each member state may permit member state nationals in possession of evidence of professional qualifications not obtained in a member state to pursue a regulated profession within the meaning of article 3(1)(a) on its territory in accordance with its rules. in the case of professions covered by title iii, chapter iii, this initial recognition shall respect the minimum training conditions laid down in that chapter.

3. where, for a given regulated profession, other specific arrangements directly related to the recognition of professional qualifications are established in a separate instrument of community law, the corresponding provisions of this directive shall not apply.

article 3

definitions

1. for the purposes of this directive, the following definitions apply:

(a) "regulated profession": a professional activity or group of professional activities, access to which, the pursuit of which, or one of the modes of pursuit of which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications; in particular, the use of a professional title limited by legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to holders of a given professional qualification shall constitute a mode of pursuit. where the first sentence of this definition does not apply, a profession referred to in paragraph 2 shall be treated as a regulated profession;

(b) "professional qualifications": qualifications attested by evidence of formal qualifications, an attestation of competence referred to in article 11, point (a) (i) and/or professional experience;

(c) "evidence of formal qualifications": diplomas, certificates and other evidence issued by an authority in a member state designated pursuant to legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions of that member state and certifying successful completion of professional training obtained mainly in the community. where the first sentence of this definition does not apply, evidence of formal qualifications referred to in paragraph 3 shall be treated as evidence of formal qualifications;

(d) "competent authority": any authority or body empowered by a member state specifically to issue or receive training diplomas and other documents or information and to receive the applications, and take the decisions, referred to in this directive;

(e) "regulated education and training": any training which is specifically geared to the pursuit of a given profession and which comprises a course or courses complemented, where appropriate, by professional training, or probationary or professional practice.

the structure and level of the professional training, probationary or professional practice shall be determined by the laws, regulations or administrative provisions of the member state concerned or monitored or approved by the authority designated for that purpose;

(f) "professional experience": the actual and lawful pursuit of the profession concerned in a member state;

(g) "adaptation period": the pursuit of a regulated profession in the host member state under the responsibility of a qualified member of that profession, such period of supervised practice possibly being accompanied by further training. this period of supervised practice shall be the subject of an assessment. the detailed rules governing the adaptation period and its assessment as well as the status of a migrant under supervision shall be laid down by the competent authority in the host member state.

the status enjoyed in the host member state by the person undergoing the period of supervised practice, in particular in the matter of right of residence as well as obligations, social rights and benefits, allowances and remuneration, shall be established by the competent authorities in that member state in accordance with applicable community law;

(h) "aptitude test": a test limited to the professional knowledge of the applicant, made by the competent authorities of the host member state with the aim of assessing the ability of the applicant to pursue a regulated profession in that member state. in order to permit this test to be carried out, the competent authorities shall draw up a list of subjects which, on the basis of a comparison of the education and training required in the member state and that received by the applicant, are not covered by the diploma or other evidence of formal qualifications possessed by the applicant.

the aptitude test must take account of the fact that the applicant is a qualified professional in the home member state or the member state from which he comes. it shall cover subjects to be selected from those on the list, knowledge of which is essential in order to be able to pursue the profession in the host member state. the test may also include knowledge of the professional rules applicable to the activities in question in the host member state.

the detailed application of the aptitude test and the status, in the host member state, of the applicant who wishes to prepare himself for the aptitude test in that state shall be determined by the competent authorities in that member state;

(i) "manager of an undertaking": any person who in an undertaking in the occupational field in question has pursued an activity:

(i) as a manager of an undertaking or a manager of a branch of an undertaking; or

(ii) as a deputy to the proprietor or the manager of an undertaking where that post involves responsibility equivalent to that of the proprietor or manager represented; or

(iii) in a managerial post with duties of a commercial and/or technical nature and with responsibility for one or more departments of the undertaking.

2. a profession practised by the members of an association or organisation listed in annex i shall be treated as a regulated profession.

the purpose of the associations or organisations referred to in the first subparagraph is, in particular, to promote and maintain a high standard in the professional field concerned. to that end they are recognised in a special form by a member state and award evidence of formal qualifications to their members, ensure that their members respect the rules of professional conduct which they prescribe, and confer on them the right to use a title or designatory letters or to benefit from a status corresponding to those formal qualifications.

on each occasion that a member state grants recognition to an association or organisation referred to in the first subparagraph, it shall inform the commission, which shall publish an appropriate notification in the official journal of the european union.

3. evidence of formal qualifications issued by a third country shall be regarded as evidence of formal qualifications if the holder has three years' professional experience in the profession concerned on the territory of the member state which recognised that evidence of formal qualifications in accordance with article 2(2), certified by that member state.

article 4

effects of recognition

1. the recognition of professional qualifications by the host member state allows the beneficiary to gain access in that member state to the same profession as that for which he is qualified in the home member state and to pursue it in the host member state under the same conditions as its nationals.

2. for the purposes of this directive, the profession which the applicant wishes to pursue in the host member state is the same as that for which he is qualified in his home member state if the activities covered are comparable.

title ii

free provision of services

article 5

principle of the free provision of services

1. without prejudice to specific provisions of community law, as well as to articles 6 and 7 of this directive, member states shall not restrict, for any reason relating to professional qualifications, the free provision of services in another member state:

(a) if the service provider is legally established in a member state for the purpose of pursuing the same profession there (hereinafter referred to as the member state of establishment), and

(b) where the service provider moves, if he has pursued that profession in the member state of establishment for at least two years during the 10 years preceding the provision of services when the profession is not regulated in that member state. the condition requiring two years' pursuit shall not apply when either the profession or the education and training leading to the profession is regulated.

2. the provisions of this title shall only apply where the service provider moves to the territory of the host member state to pursue, on a temporary and occasional basis, the profession referred to in paragraph 1.

the temporary and occasional nature of the provision of services shall be assessed case by case, in particular in relation to its duration, its frequency, its regularity and its continuity.

3. where a service provider moves, he shall be subject to professional rules of a professional, statutory or administrative nature which are directly linked to professional qualifications, such as the definition of the profession, the use of titles and serious professional malpractice which is directly and specifically linked to consumer protection and safety, as well as disciplinary provisions which are applicable in the host member state to professionals who pursue the same profession in that member state.

article 6

exemptions

pursuant to article 5(1), the host member state shall exempt service providers established in another member state from the requirements which it places on professionals established in its territory relating to:

(a) authorisation by, registration with or membership of a professional organisation or body. in order to facilitate the application of disciplinary provisions in force on their territory according to article 5(3), member states may provide either for automatic temporary registration with or for pro forma membership of such a professional organisation or body, provided that such registration or membership does not delay or complicate in any way the provision of services and does not entail any additional costs for the service provider. a copy of the declaration and, where applicable, of the renewal referred to in article 7(1), accompanied, for professions which have implications for public health and safety referred to in article 7(4) or which benefit from automatic recognition under title iii chapter iii, by a copy of the documents referred to in article 7(2) shall be sent by the competent authority to the relevant professional organisation or body, and this shall constitute automatic temporary registration or pro forma membership for this purpose;

(b) registration with a public social security body for the purpose of settling accounts with an insurer relating to activities pursued for the benefit of insured persons.

the service provider shall, however, inform in advance or, in an urgent case, afterwards, the body referred to in point (b) of the services which he has provided.

article 7

declaration to be made in advance, if the service provider moves

1. member states may require that, where the service provider first moves from one member state to another in order to provide services, he shall inform the competent authority in the host member state in a written declaration to be made in advance including the details of any insurance cover or other means of personal or collective protection with regard to professional liability. such declaration shall be renewed once a year if the service provider intends to provide temporary or occasional services in that member state during that year. the service provider may supply the declaration by any means.

2. moreover, for the first provision of services or if there is a material change in the situation substantiated by the documents, member states may require that the declaration be accompanied by the following documents:

(a) proof of the nationality of the service provider;

(b) an attestation certifying that the holder is legally established in a member state for the purpose of pursuing the activities concerned and that he is not prohibited from practising, even temporarily, at the moment of delivering the attestation;

(c) evidence of professional qualifications;

(d) for cases referred to in article 5(1)(b), any means of proof that the service provider has pursued the activity concerned for at least two years during the previous ten years;

(e) for professions in the security sector, where the member state so requires for its own nationals, evidence of no criminal convictions.

3. the service shall be provided under the professional title of the member state of establishment, in so far as such a title exists in that member state for the professional activity in question. that title shall be indicated in the official language or one of the official languages of the member state of establishment in such a way as to avoid any confusion with the professional title of the host member state. where no such professional title exists in the member state of establishment, the service provider shall indicate his formal qualification in the official language or one of the official languages of that member state. by way of exception, the service shall be provided under the professional title of the host member state for cases referred to in title iii chapter iii.

4. for the first provision of services, in the case of regulated professions having public health or safety implications, which do not benefit from automatic recognition under title iii chapter iii, the competent authority of the host member state may check the professional qualifications of the service provider prior to the first provision of services. such a prior check shall be possible only where the purpose of the check is to avoid serious damage to the health or safety of the service recipient due to a lack of professional qualification of the service provider and where this does not go beyond what is necessary for that purpose.

within a maximum of one month of receipt of the declaration and accompanying documents, the competent authority shall endeavour to inform the service provider either of its decision not to check his qualifications or of the outcome of such check. where there is a difficulty which would result in delay, the competent authority shall notify the service provider within the first month of the reason for the delay and the timescale for a decision, which must be finalised within the second month of receipt of completed documentation.

where there is a substantial difference between the professional qualifications of the service provider and the training required in the host member state, to the extent that that difference is such as to be harmful to public health or safety, the host member state shall give the service provider the opportunity to show, in particular by means of an aptitude test, that he has acquired the knowledge or competence lacking. in any case, it must be possible to provide the service within one month of a decision being taken in accordance with the previous subparagraph.

in the absence of a reaction of the competent authority within the deadlines set in the previous subparagraphs, the service may be provided.

in cases where qualifications have been verified under this paragraph, the service shall be provided under the professional title of the host member state.

article 12

equal treatment of qualifications

any evidence of formal qualifications or set of evidence of formal qualifications issued by a competent authority in a member state, certifying successful completion of training in the community which is recognised by that member state as being of an equivalent level and which confers on the holder the same rights of access to or pursuit of a profession or prepares for the pursuit of that profession, shall be treated as evidence of formal qualifications of the type covered by article 11, including the level in question.

any professional qualification which, although not satisfying the requirements contained in the legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions in force in the home member state for access to or the pursuit of a profession, confers on the holder acquired rights by virtue of these provisions, shall also be treated as such evidence of formal qualifications under the same conditions as set out in the first subparagraph. this applies in particular if the home member state raises the level of training required for admission to a profession and for its exercise, and if an individual who has undergone former training, which does not meet the requirements of the new qualification, benefits from acquired rights by virtue of national legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions; in such case this former training is considered by the host member state, for the purposes of the application of article 13, as corresponding to the level of the new training.

article 13

conditions for recognition

1. if access to or pursuit of a regulated profession in a host member state is contingent upon possession of specific professional qualifications, the competent authority of that member state shall permit access to and pursuit of that profession, under the same conditions as apply to its nationals, to applicants possessing the attestation of competence or evidence of formal qualifications required by another member state in order to gain access to and pursue that profession on its territory.

attestations of competence or evidence of formal qualifications shall satisfy the following conditions:

(a) they shall have been issued by a competent authority in a member state, designated in accordance with the legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions of that member state;

(b) they shall attest a level of professional qualification at least equivalent to the level immediately prior to that which is required in the host member state, as described in article 11.

2. access to and pursuit of the profession, as described in paragraph 1, shall also be granted to applicants who have pursued the profession referred to in that paragraph on a full-time basis for two years during the previous 10 years in another member state which does not regulate that profession, providing they possess one or more attestations of competence or documents providing evidence of formal qualifications.

attestations of competence and evidence of formal qualifications shall satisfy the following conditions:

(a) they shall have been issued by a competent authority in a member state, designated in accordance with the legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions of that member state;

(b) they shall attest a level of professional qualification at least equivalent to the level immediately prior to that required in the host member state, as described in article 11;

(c) they shall attest that the holder has been prepared for the pursuit of the profession in question.

the two years' professional experience referred to in the first subparagraph may not, however, be required if the evidence of formal qualifications which the applicant possesses certifies regulated education and training within the meaning of article 3(1)(e) at the levels of qualifications described in article 11, points (b), (c), (d) or (e). the regulated education and training listed in annex iii shall be considered as such regulated education and training at the level described in article 11, point (c). the list in annex iii may be amended in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 58(2) in order to take account of regulated education and training which provides a comparable professional standard and which prepares the trainee for a comparable level of responsibilities and functions.

3. by way of derogation from paragraph 1, point (b) and to paragraph 2, point (b), the host member state shall permit access and pursuit of a regulated profession where access to this profession is contingent in its territory upon possession of a qualification certifying successful completion of higher or university education of four years' duration, and where the applicant possesses a qualification referred to in article 11, point (c).

article 14

compensation measures

1. article 13 does not preclude the host member state from requiring the applicant to complete an adaptation period of up to three years or to take an aptitude test if:

(a) the duration of the training of which he provides evidence under the terms of article 13, paragraph 1 or 2, is at least one year shorter than that required by the host member state;

(b) the training he has received covers substantially different matters than those covered by the evidence of formal qualifications required in the host member state;

(c) the regulated profession in the host member state comprises one or more regulated professional activities which do not exist in the corresponding profession in the applicant's home member state within the meaning of article 4(2), and that difference consists in specific training which is required in the host member state and which covers substantially different matters from those covered by the applicant's attestation of competence or evidence of formal qualifications.

2. if the host member state makes use of the option provided for in paragraph 1, it must offer the applicant the choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test.

where a member state considers, with respect to a given profession, that it is necessary to derogate from the requirement, set out in the previous subparagraph, that it give the applicant a choice between an adaptation period and an aptitude test, it shall inform the other member states and the commission in advance and provide sufficient justification for the derogation.

if, after receiving all necessary information, the commission considers that the derogation referred to in the second subparagraph is inappropriate or that it is not in accordance with community law, it shall, within three months, ask the member state in question to refrain from taking the envisaged measure. in the absence of a response from the commission within the abovementioned deadline, the derogation may be applied.

3. by way of derogation from the principle of the right of the applicant to choose, as laid down in paragraph 2, for professions whose pursuit requires precise knowledge of national law and in respect of which the provision of advice and/or assistance concerning national law is an essential and constant aspect of the professional activity, the host member state may stipulate either an adaptation period or an aptitude test.

this applies also to the cases provided for in article 10 points (b) and (c), in article 10 point (d) concerning doctors and dental practitioners, in article 10 point (f) when the migrant seeks recognition in another member state where the relevant professional activities are pursued by nurses responsible for general care or specialised nurses holding evidence of formal qualifications as a specialist which follows the training leading to the possession of the titles listed in annex v, point 5.2.2 and in article 10 point (g).

in the cases covered by article 10 point (a), the host member state may require an adaptation period or an aptitude test if the migrant envisages pursuing professional activities in a self-employed capacity or as a manager of an undertaking which require the knowledge and the application of the specific national rules in force, provided that knowledge and application of those rules are required by the competent authorities of the host member state for access to such activities by its own nationals.

4. for the purpose of applying paragraph 1 points (b) and (c), "substantially different matters" means matters of which knowledge is essential for pursuing the profession and with regard to which the training received by the migrant shows important differences in terms of duration or content from the training required by the host member state.

5. paragraph 1 shall be applied with due regard to the principle of proportionality. in particular, if the host member state intends to require the applicant to complete an adaptation period or take an aptitude test, it must first ascertain whether the knowledge acquired by the applicant in the course of his professional experience in a member state or in a third country, is of a nature to cover, in full or in part, the substantial difference referred to in paragraph 4.

article 15

waiving of compensation measures on the basis of common platforms

1. for the purpose of this article, "common platforms" is defined as a set of criteria of professional qualifications which are suitable for compensating for substantial differences which have been identified between the training requirements existing in the various member states for a given profession. these substantial differences shall be identified by comparison between the duration and contents of the training in at least two thirds of the member states, including all member states which regulate this profession. the differences in the contents of the training may result from substantial differences in the scope of the professional activities.

2. common platforms as defined in paragraph 1 may be submitted to the commission by member states or by professional associations or organisations which are representative at national and european level. if the commission, after consulting the member states, is of the opinion that a draft common platform facilitates the mutual recognition of professional qualifications, it may present draft measures with a view to their adoption in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 58(2).

3. where the applicant's professional qualifications satisfy the criteria established in the measure adopted in accordance with paragraph 2, the host member state shall waive the application of compensation measures under article 14.

4. paragraphs 1 to 3 shall not affect the competence of member states to decide the professional qualifications required for the pursuit of professions in their territory as well as the contents and the organisation of their systems of education and professional training.

5. if a member state considers that the criteria established in a measure adopted in accordance with paragraph 2 no longer offer adequate guarantees with regard to professional qualifications, it shall inform the commission accordingly, which shall, if appropriate, present a draft measure in accordance with the procedure referred to in article 58(2).

6. the commission shall, by 20 october 2010, submit to the european parliament and the council a report on the operation of this article and, if necessary, appropriate proposals for amending this article.
